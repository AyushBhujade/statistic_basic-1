    "  Understanding the level of measurement is crucial in data analysis as it determines the statistical methods suitable for interpreting the data. For   example, nominal data (categories without inherent order) may only allow for frequency counts, while ordinal data (categories with a meaningful       order) permits ranking. Interval and ratio data involve numeric values with known intervals, enabling more advanced statistical analyses like mean     and standard deviation calculations. Choosing the appropriate analysis method ensures accurate and meaningful insights from the data."

    "A box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) is a suitable type of plot for displaying data in terms of range. It provides a visual representation of the distribution of a dataset, including key statistics such as the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. The box in the plot represents the interquartile range (IQR), while the \"whiskers\" show the range of the data. This makes a box plot effective for identifying the spread and central tendency of a dataset, particularly when considering the range of values."
